# ATM_Project
The Enhanced ATM System with Audio Integration is a C++ project designed to provide an immersive and user-friendly experience by incorporating an audio system into the traditional ATM functionality. The project is split into two sets to accommodate different configurations for systems with and without the additional audio library.
